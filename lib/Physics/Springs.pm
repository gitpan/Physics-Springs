=head1 NAME

Physics::Springs - Simulate Particle Dynamics with Springs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Physics::Springs;

=head1 ABSTRACT

  Simulate particle dynamics with springs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is intended as an add-on to the Physics::Particles module
(version 1.00 or higher required) and may be used to simulate particle
dynamics including spring-like forces between any two particles you specify.

Since version 1.00 of this module, Physics::Particles version 1.00 is required.
Version 1.00 is neither compatible to earlier versions nor to any versions
below 1.00 of Physics::Particles and Physics::Springs::Friction.

The module extends the API of Physics::Particles by one method which is
documented below. Please see the documentation to Physics::Particles for
more information about the API.

There are several particle properties required by Physics::Springs in
order to work: These are the x/y/z coordinates, the vx/vy/vz
velocity vector components, and a non-zero mass 'm'. Furthermore, it uses
the _fx, _fy, _fz properties which the user should never modify directly.

=head2 Methods

=over 2

=item add_spring

You may use the add_spring method to add springs to the system of particles.
Each spring has a starting and end particle, a relaxed length, and a spring
constant 'k'.

add_spring expects several named arguments. Required arguments are:
The spring constant k, the starting (p1) and end (p2) points.
Optional arguments are: The length of the relaxed spring 'len'.
If len is not specified, the current distance between p1 and p2 will be
used as the length of the relaxed spring.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Some error messages you may encounter:

  "Precondition 1 not met for Physics::Springs::new()."
  new() does not take any parameters.
  
  "Postcondition 1 not met for Physics::Springs::new()"
  Complain to the author of the module. He screwed up.

  "Physics::Springs::new called in void context."
  It doesn't make sense to call constructors without action-at-a-distance
  in void context so don't.
  
  "Precondition 1 not met for Physics::Springs::add_spring()"
  add_spring() takes at least nine arguments.

  "Postcondition 1 not met for Physics::Springs::add_spring()"
  Complain to the author of the module. He screwed up.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The newest version of this module may be found on CPAN or
http://steffen-mueller.net

The module this module subclasses: L<Physics::Particles>

A module that adds force field-like forces to the simulation:
L<Physics::Springs::Friction>

L<Math::Project3D>, L<Math::Project3D::Plot> for a reasonably
simple way to visualize your data.
